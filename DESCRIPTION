Description: The main functionality of the this package is to detect DNA
    sequence patterns that are likely to fold into an intramolecular
    G-quadruplex (G4). Unlike many other approaches, this package is able
    to detect sequences responsible for G4s folded from imperfect G-runs
    containing bulges or mismatches and as such is more sensitive than
    competing algorithms.
