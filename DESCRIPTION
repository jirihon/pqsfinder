Description: The main functionality of the this package is to detect DNA
    sequence patterns that are likely to fold into an intramolecular G-quadruplex
    (G4). Unlike many other approaches, this package is able to detect G4 folded
    from imperfect G-runs containing bulges or mismatches and as such is more
    sensitive and accurate than competing solutions.
